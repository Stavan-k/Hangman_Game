# Hangman_Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game, developed in Python. The game features a basic text-based interface and provides a fun way to test your word-guessing skills.

Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:
1. <u>word_list.py</u>: Contains a list of words that will be used in the game.
   
2. <u>hangman_body.py</u>: Contains art representations of the hangman figure. This visual feedback shows the progress of the hangman figure as incorrect guesses are made.

3. <u>hangman_game.py</u>: The main Python script that runs the game. It reads from word_list.py to select words and from hangman_body.py to display the hangman figure. This script handles the game logic, user input, and game display.
